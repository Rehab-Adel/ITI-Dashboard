# Student Management System

Welcome to the Students Management System project! This simple web application allows you to manage a group of student data using pure JavaScript. The application covers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, as well as a search functionality for navigating through the list of students. All data is stored in the local storage for seamless data persistence.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new student records with details such as name, email, password, address, track, and enrollment date.

- **Read:** View the list of students in a table, displaying key information for each student.

- **Update:** Modify existing student records, with the ability to edit name, email, password, address, track, and enrollment date.

- **Delete:** Remove individual student records or clear the entire list of students.

- **Search:** Easily search for specific students by name, dynamically updating the displayed list.
